# Detailed Explanation of the Tool (`Free-PALESTINE Tool`)

## Main Objective

This tool is designed to perform a **Denial of Service (`DoS`)** attack against web servers using `HTTP`/`HTTPS` requests.  
The main goals of the tool are:

- Flood the target server with a massive number of requests.  
- Consume server resources (`CPU`, `memory`, and `network connections`).  
- Make the server slow or completely unresponsive.

---

## How Does the Tool Work?

### 1. Data Input:

The user is asked to enter:

- The target `IP address`.  
- The `port` (e.g., `80` for `HTTP` or `443` for `HTTPS`).  
- The number of packets sent per second.  
- The number of `threads`.

---

### 2. Starting the Attack:

- The tool creates several `threads` (based on the specified number).  
- Each thread executes the attack in parallel.

---

### 3. Attack Mechanism for Each Thread:

**Establishing a `TCP` Connection:**

- Connects to the target server via the specified `port`.  
- If the port is `443` (`HTTPS`), it uses an encrypted connection (`SSL/TLS`).

**Creating Fake `HTTP` Requests:**

- The `HTTP` method is chosen randomly (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, ...).  
- Fake paths are generated such as `/api/user` or `/search?q=...`.  
- Random headers are added, including:

  - `User-Agent`: Pretending to be different browsers (`Chrome`, `Firefox`, `iPhone`, ...).  
  - `Referer`: Fake search links (`Google`, `Bing`, ...).  
  - `Cookies`: Random identification data.  
  - `X-Forwarded-For`: Spoofed `IP` addresses.

**Sending Extra Data:**

- After the main request, random data (up to `8192` bytes) is sent to increase pressure.  
- The data may be compressed using `gzip` to add more load to the server.

**Retry on Failure:**

- If the connection fails, the thread retries after a short wait.

---

## Advanced Features

### Request Variety:

- Weighted use of `GET` / `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` requests.  
- Random `POST` data (`JSON`, `XML`, `Form Data`).  
- `gzip`-compressed content to increase server load.

### Attack Statistics:

Real-time display of:

- Packets sent per second (`PPS`).  
- Bandwidth usage (`Mbps`).  
- Number of successful/failed connections.  
- Attack duration.
